# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PSA Network Analyzer™ Configuration File (Patched Version)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file controls all the scoring logic, column mapping, and persona rules.
# This patched version includes more scoring factors for richer analysis.

# --- 1. Column Mapping ---
# Maps the column names from your input CSV to the standardized names the app uses.
column_mapping:
  # FIX: Corrected indentation for all mappings.
  First Name: 'First Name'
  Last Name: 'Last Name'
  Company: 'Company'
  Position: 'Position'
  Connected On: 'Connected_On'
  # --- ADD NEW MAPPINGS FOR RICHER DATA ---
  # To use these, you must add these columns to your CSV file.
  # Mutual Connections: 'Mutual_Connections' # Example from some data sources
  Relevance: 'Relevance_Score' # Example of a manual score you add (1-100)

# --- 2. Trust Score Parameters ---
# Defines how the 'Trust_Score' is calculated.
# The weights should ideally sum to 1.0.
trust_score_parameters:
  weights:
    # I've adjusted the weights to be more balanced.
    # The scoring now considers how recent a connection is and its relevance.
    Days_Since_Connection: 0.5
    Relevance_Score: 0.5
    # Uncomment the line below if you add this column to your CSV.
    # Mutual_Connections: 0.3

# --- 3. Composite Score Weights ---
# Defines the final 'Composite_Score'. For now, it's just the Trust_Score.
composite_score_weights:
  Trust_Score: 1.0

# --- 4. Action Tiers & Labels ---
# Defines the score thresholds for each recommended action.
thresholds:
  keep: 80
  cultivate: 60
  nurture: 40
  monitor: 20

# Human-readable labels for the action tiers.
action_labels:
  keep: "✅ Keep"
  cultivate: "🌱 Cultivate"
  nurture: "💧 Nurture"
  monitor: "👀 Monitor"
  withdraw: "❌ Archive / Withdraw"

# --- 5. Persona Rules ---
# I've added more complex rules to demonstrate the power of personas.
persona_rules:
  "Key Ally":
    - column: "Trust_Score"
      operator: ">="
      value: 80
    - column: "Recommended_Action"
      operator: "in"
      value: "Keep" # Checks for the word "Keep" in "✅ Keep"
  "Rising Star":
    - column: "Days_Since_Connection"
      operator: "<"
      value: 180 # Connected in the last 6 months
    - column: "Trust_Score"
      operator: ">="
      value: 50
  "Ghost":
    - column: "Days_Since_Connection"
      operator: ">"
      value: 730 # More than 2 years since connecting
    - column: "Trust_Score"
      operator: "<"
      value: 30
      
  # FIX: Split "Domain Expert" into two separate personas to achieve OR logic.
  "Director-Level":
    - column: "Position"
      operator: "in"
      value: "Director"

  "VP-Level":
    - column: "Position"
      operator: "in"
      value: "VP"
