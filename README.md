## 🔍 Overview

The **PSA Contact Scorer** evaluates the **strategic, ethical, and relational quality** of your LinkedIn or CRM network.

Built as part of the **Presence Signaling Architecture (PSA™)**, this tool identifies who in your network aligns, reciprocates, fades, or obstructs — using transparent, config-driven scoring logic.

It’s not a popularity contest. It’s a visibility system — for those left out of them.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

- **📊 Composite Signal Scoring**  
  Trust, relevance, engagement, domain alignment, and more — all weighted from a YAML file you control.

- **🧠 Persona Tagging**  
  Transparent assignment of network role types like *Ally*, *Dormant Potential*, *Ghost*, *Connector*.

- **🚦 Action Recommendations**  
  Tiered decisions: *Keep*, *Cultivate*, *Nurture*, *Monitor*, or *Withdraw* — driven by score thresholds.

- **🔍 Trust Signal Preprocessing**  
  Uses real indicators (recency, mutuals, recommendations) to calculate a meaningful `Trust_Score`.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upload your LinkedIn or CRM export CSV file.
2. The system preprocesses it (adds `Trust_Score`, etc.).
3. It evaluates each contact and assigns:
   - `Composite_Score`
   - `Recommended_Action`
   - `Persona_Tags`
4. You download a ranked CSV — and finally see your network clearly.

All logic is controlled by the `config.yaml` — nothing hidden.
